That self-awareness and satire were absent in the pop of the new millennium, where even the best of the lot operated only on one level, which may be why <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lady-gaga-mn0000994823"">Lady GaGa</a> turned into such a sensation in 2009: everybody was <em>thirsty</em> for music like this, music for and about their lives, both real and virtual. To a certain extent, the reaction to <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-fame-mw0001327294"">The Fame</a> may have been a little too enthusiastic, with <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gaga-mn0000994823"">GaGa</a> turning inescapable sometime in the summer of 2009, when she appeared on countless magazine covers while both <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weezer-mn0000243008"">Weezer</a> and <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/daughtry-mn0000567153"">DAUGHTRY</a> covered _ã–Pokerface,_ãù the rush to attention suggesting that she was the second coming of <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/madonna-mn0000237205"">Madonna</a> , a comparison <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gaga-mn0000994823"">GaGa</a> cheerfully courts and one that_ã_s accurate if perhaps overextended.

Sure, <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gaga-mn0000994823"">GaGa</a> sings of disco sticks, bluffin_ã_ with her muffin, and rough sex, but her provocation doesn_ã_t derive solely from her words: this is music that sounds thickly sexy with its stainless steel synths and dark disco rhythms. Where <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gaga-mn0000994823"">GaGa</a> excels, and why she crossed over, is how she doesn_ã_t leave all this as a collection of hooks and rhythms, she shapes them into full-blown pop songs, taking the time to let the album breathe with chillout ballads and percolating new wave, like the title track that echoes <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gwen-stefani-mn0000546214"">Gwen Stefani</a> in dance diva mode. But where <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gwen-mn0000546214"">Gwen</a> simply celebrates celeb consumer culture, <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gaga-mn0000994823"">GaGa</a> bites, her litany of runway models, pornographic girls, and body plastic delivered with an undercurrent of disdain, even as she loves all the glitz. This dichotomy propels much of <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-fame-mw0001327294"">The Fame</a> , particularly on the clever _ã–Paparazzi,_ãù where she casts herself as the photographic parasite chasing after her crush, but none of this meta text would work if the songs didn_ã_t click, functioning simultaneously as glorious pop trash and a wicked parody of it. </p>"

Inevitably, this emphasis on production means the pop in <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/artpop-mw0002573777"">ARTPOP</a> winds up diminished; perhaps it's ""pop"" in the pop-art sense, as it's shamelessly intentionally populist, but as pop music it's stiff, relying not on hooks in either its melody or rhythm, but rather a full-on glitz blitz that can dazzle as often as it tires. Lost in her self-generated mythos, <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gaga-mn0000994823"">Gaga</a> doesn't much care whether her music sticks as long as she's not ignored -- even such seemingly soul-baring moments as the single-spotlight showcase ""Dope"" aren't confessional so much as gear shifts designed to capture attention -- and <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/artpop-mw0002573777"">ARTPOP</a> continually demands attention as it eschews the notion of love, right down to how all the sex songs deliberately separate the body from the soul.

This same arrogance glides her through songs about style -- the ludicrous ""Donatella,"" a tribute to Versace that borders on character assassination; ""Fashion!,"" which isn't a <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-bowie-mn0000531986"">David Bowie</a> cover, no matter how much it longs to be -- and through the songs about drugs, a cycle that takes her toward a concluding coda where <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gaga-mn0000994823"">Gaga</a> stands resplendent in the applause. The concept is artful and logical, yet <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/artpop-mw0002573777"">ARTPOP</a> never insinuates or settles in the subconscious; it always assaults, determined to make an impression even when all it has to say is that it doesn't have much to say. </p>"

King is not only a timeless singer and guitarist, he's also a natural-born entertainer, and on Live at the Regal the listener is treated to an exhibition of all three of his talents. Over percolating horn hits and rolling shuffles, King treats an enthusiastic audience (at some points, they shriek after he delivers each line) to a collection of some of his greatest hits. The backing band is razor-sharp, picking up the leader's cues with almost telepathic accuracy. King's voice is rarely in this fine of form, shifting effortlessly between his falsetto and his regular range, hitting the microphone hard for gritty emphasis and backing off in moments of almost intimate tenderness. Nowhere is this more evident than at the climax of ""How Blue Can You Get,"" where the Chicago venue threatens to explode at King's prompting. Of course, the master's guitar is all over this record, and his playing here is among the best in his long career. Displaying a jazz sensibility, King's lines are sophisticated without losing their grit. More than anything else, Live at the Regal is a textbook example of how to set up a live performance. Talking to the crowd, setting up the tunes with a vignette, King is the consummate entertainer. Live at the Regal is an absolutely necessary acquisition for fans of B.B. King or blues music in general. A high point, perhaps even the high point, for uptown blues.</p>"

At one time, most of those solos were played by <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/king-mn0000059156"">King</a> on his guitar, but now he is content to give the showcase to his horn players, as he does on ""Blues Man,"" or organist <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/james-toney-mn0001469474"">James Toney</a> , who claims the lion's share of ""Rock Me Baby."" There is still plenty of guitar work, however, and <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/king-mn0000059156"">King</a> remains seemingly as agile as ever. He is also a relaxed, comfortable frontman, engaging in easy banter with both band and audience. And he even seems at peace with the notion that the road can't go on forever. ""Key to the Highway"" has something of an elegiac tone, and it ends with a promise that for <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/king-mn0000059156"">King</a> seems to be no more than a simple statement of fact: ""I'm gonna do this till I die, folks."" </p>"

He loosens his tie on this set though, recorded at a single show in February 2010. The veteran frontman tears into his staccato guitar solos with gusto here, extending the tunes and singing with a rawness often lacking in his studio work. His band also pushes harder, especially longtime keyboardist/songwriter <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jim-pugh-mn0000074339"">Jim Pugh</a> , whose featured solos match <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> 's own intensity and are spotlighted throughout. This is soul-bluesman <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> 's third live release in four years (2010's <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/authorized-bootleg-mw0001980946"">Authorized Bootleg</a> dated back to a 1987 show), but the only one that includes a full concert DVD -- adding two more cuts, ""Phone Booth"" and ""Twenty"" -- along with the audio. He has only recorded one studio disc in that time, four selections from which are reprised. Only a few songs will be familiar to anyone but hardcore fans, including spirited workouts on '80s hits ""Smoking Gun"" and ""Right Next Door,"" along with ""Our Last Time,"" the latter two already included on 2006's <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-from-across-the-pond-mw0000734663"">Live from Across the Pond</a> . Two other tracks also appear on that previous double concert CD, which raises the question of why, with as many albums as <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> has accumulated, he couldn't dig back and find different material. A cover of ""Sitting on Top of the World"" is dirtier than you'd expect, and in general the sweat flows when the guitarist pushes his R&amp;B deeper into the blues as his band grinds into a groove often absent from his more polished catalog. He pulls out guitar effects that creatively double-track his solo on ""Lotta Lovin',"" another ballad that sounds far more heartbroken and personal here than on 2003's <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/time-will-tell-mw0000036363"">Time Will Tell</a> , where it first appeared. <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> 's vocal howls and grunts as he tears into tight, energized guitar solos show that he's been captured on an inspired night, even on ""Smoking Gun,"" a tune he's been playing nightly for over two decades. It makes for a surprisingly tough and uncompromising performance that shows <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/robert-cray-mn0000830425"">Robert Cray</a> in a different light than many would have expected based solely on his impressive if somewhat similar-sounding and often sterile albums. </p>"

He retains the same backing trio on this 2012 release as on 2009's studio disc, with the only major difference in personnel being the addition of noted roots producer <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kevin-shirley-mn0000769303"">Kevin Shirley</a> . Lyrically detailed story ballads about the trials and tribulations of love, with an emphasis on broken relationships, remain his strong suit as song titles such as ""Sadder Days,"" ""Fix This,"" ""I'll Always Remember You,"" ""Won't Be Coming Home,"" and even the album's title imply. Yet there are enough change-ups and excellent songs here to keep the pace varied. Horns that <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> hasn't utilized in a while make a welcome appearance on a few key tunes such as the big-band swing of ""I'll Always Remember You"" (which seems like a tribute to <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ray-charles-mn0000046861"">Ray Charles</a> ) and the terrifically melodic, midtempo ""Blues Get Off My Shoulder."" A little <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chuck-berry-mn0000120521"">Chuck Berry</a> rocking in the snappy and humorous ""Side Dish"" shows that this band can crank up the energy when the occasion calls for it. Even if their brand of rock &amp; roll is a little on the clean-cut side, the track has a rawness and good-time feeling that is typically not associated with <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> . But the album's emotional and philosophical centerpiece is the nearly nine-minute ""I'm Done Cryin'."" This searing, contemporary portrait is of a male protagonist who has lost his home and his job to outsourcing but retains his dignity ""because I'm still a man."" <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/shirley-mn0000769303"">Shirley</a> adds understated but beautifully arranged strings to emphasize the sheer desperation of the situation then strips them away, leaving just <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> 's soulful voice. Add one of the guitarist's patented terse, quivering solos that feels like a crying vocal, and you get a tour de force track that is one of the highlights of <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> 's bulging catalog. And with 15 previous albums, that's saying plenty. The description of how a wrecked marriage is revealed in the empty residence a couple left behind in ""Great Big Old House"" is prime <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> , too, and a worthy successor to any of his other popular busted matrimony songs. Even if the guitarist has worked this terrain plenty of times before, he is still refining and even improving the template. That makes this another quality entry in a catalog of albums over a three-decade-and-counting-year career that has remarkably few weak spots. </p>"

His work with <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-blind-boys-of-alabama-mn0000568725"">the Blind Boys of Alabama</a> showed him to be welcomed by veteran artists who clearly felt he was a kindred spirit. Harpist/guitarist <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/charlie-musselwhite-mn0000211627"">Charlie Musselwhite</a> 's extensive rê©sumê© typically moved him past the often limiting structure of the Chicago blues where he first made his presence felt, to Tex-Mex, Cuban, Americana, swamp rock, country, and even jazz. The two connected on a 1997 <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-lee-hooker-mn0000815039"">John Lee Hooker</a> session and have worked together intermittently since, both live and in the studio. This outing, tellingly released on the Concord/Stax imprint, strips the sound down, occasionally to just acoustic guitar and harp as on the opening of ""Don't Think Twice,"" and the closing deep Delta blues ""All That Matters Now,"" reworked into ""It Hurts Me Too."" But the duo also plug in for tough, rugged blues and blues-rock as on the heart thumping ""I'm in I'm Out and I'm Gone,"" a twist on <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-bowie-mn0000531986"">David Bowie</a> 's ""The Jene Genie"" riff that itself was nabbed from the Chicago blues catalog. Even with <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/musselwhite-mn0000211627"">Musselwhite</a> 's substantial involvement, this is <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/harper-mn0000792733"">Harper</a> 's show as he produces, sings every song, and seems to be leading the music's direction with the harmonica player urging him on and adding to the already deep groove. They dip into harder rocking territory for the charging ""I Don't Believe a Word You Say"" with <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/musselwhite-mn0000211627"">Musselwhite</a> pulling out his <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/little-walter-mn0000824599"">Little Walter</a> influences with electrified blowing. The skeletal, ghostly, repeated riff of the deadly gunslinger ""I Ride at Dawn"" is a stark reminder of how less is more as Harper's slide enhances the dangerous elements reflected in the song's ominous lyrics. The six-minute title track -- the disc's longest cut -- is classic <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/harper-mn0000792733"">Harper</a> , marrying a funky bassline with the declaration expressed in the song's title as <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/musselwhite-mn0000211627"">Musselwhite</a> takes a few licks from <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/paul-butterfield-mn0000019339"">Paul Butterfield</a> to edge the track into a laid-back red zone where the singer typically thrives. But the twosome have some fun, too, in particular on the spirited, easygoing, sexed-up blues ""She Got Kick,"" one of the few instances where harmonica is not an integral component of the mix. Ultimately, <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/get-up%21-mw0002440554"">Get Up!</a> earns its titular exclamation point as a successful combination of two talented veterans feeding off each other's dusky, creative spirit. </p>"

His signature heavily processed tone and liquid playing characterize barnburning runs like the funky ""Velorum"" and the roadhouse stomp of ""Gravity Storm,"" while softer tracks like ""Creamsicle Sunset"" and ""The Moon and I"" wander longingly through various time signatures and modes, the later dabbling with Middle Eastern scales. The most winning moments on <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-story-of-light-mw0002395751"">The Story of Light</a> are the unexpected ones, as with ""No More Amsterdam,"" a zigzagging ballad about the ennui of world travel that finds <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/vai-mn0000045475"">Vai</a> duetting with singer/songwriter institution <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/aimee-mann-mn0000610346"">Aimee Mann</a> , who also wrote the song's lyrics.

This surprising cut is sung largely by <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/beverly-mcclellan-mn0002692447"">Beverly McClellan</a> from television's <em>The Voice</em> , backed by a full gospel choir with samples of <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/johnson-mn0000040137"">Johnson</a> 's original recording of the song sampled in intermittently. The effect, much like the entire album, is epic, but not the type of epic we've come to expect from one of the longer-running guitar gods of his era.

These, of course, are ""Material Girl"" and ""Like a Virgin,"" the two songs that made her an icon, and the two songs that remain definitive statements. They overshadow the rest of the record, not just because they are a perfect match of theme and sound, but because the rest of the album vacillates wildly in terms of quality. The other two singles, ""Angel"" and ""Dress You Up,"" are excellent standard-issue dance-pop, and there are other moments that work well (""Over and Over,"" ""Stay,"" the earnest cover of <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rose-royce-mn0000343215"">Rose Royce</a> 's ""Love Don't Live Here""), but overall, it adds up to less than the sum of its parts -- partially because the singles are so good, but also because on the first album, she stunned with style and a certain joy. Here, the calculation is apparent, and while that's part of <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/madonna-mn0000237205"">Madonna</a> 's essence -- even something that makes her fun -- it throws the record's balance off a little too much for it to be consistent, even if it justifiably made her a star. </p>"

Sure, she could still sing, but her music was now driven entirely by skeletal club grooves and explicit carnality. It was a bold break from the teenybopper persona she was desperate to shed, but it was overcorrective steering, taking her a little bit too far down the road toward a grotesque caricature, particularly in her ugly video for the album's lead single, ""Dirrty.""

Eventually, all the bad blood cooled and the trio once again reunited, this time with <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bonham-mn0000218777"">Bonham</a> 's son <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jason-mn0000089017"">Jason</a> on drums, for a full-fledged set as the headliners for the 2007 <em>Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert</em> .

Why is <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/celebration-day-mw0002423203"">Celebration Day</a> such a resounding success? The snide answer is rehearsal: <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/zeppelin-mn0000139026"">Zeppelin</a> knew their previous two returns to the stage weren't up to snuff so they spent a great deal of time woodshedding, realizing their reputation was on the line. And since none of the participants were truly tempted by an ongoing reunion, one where they would have to hawk the same set list at every corner of the globe for over a year, they decided to pour all they had into this one-off concert, betting that one great gig would trump a globe-conquering tour. They were right. <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/celebration-day-mw0002423203"">Celebration Day</a> is an ideal coda for <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/led-zeppelin-mn0000139026"">Led Zeppelin</a> , proof that the group's skills only deepened with age. Never once does the group sound as if they're grasping at re-creating their youth; they've selected a set heavy on blues, atmosphere, and hits, songs that allow each member -- including <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jason-bonham-mn0000089017"">Jason Bonham</a> -- to stretch out and casually flaunt his skills. <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/plant-mn0000830538"">Plant</a> may no longer be able to reach the soaring highs he did in the '70s, but his lowered range gives ""Black Dog"" and ""The Song Remains the Same"" gravity, and helps give ""Trampled Under Foot"" a gut-level punch. <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/page-mn0000089021"">Page</a> still can muff a note or two -- so can the band, actually, with <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/plant-mn0000830538"">Plant</a> missing a line on the opening ""Good Times Bad Times,"" a mistake that's thankfully left uncorrected -- but his imagination is unchained, and, when compared to the <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/page-mn0000089021"">Page</a> / <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/plant-mn0000830538"">Plant</a> records of the '90s, it becomes clear how much <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jones-mn0000231997"">Jones</a> contributed to the band's chemistry, lending it grit and funk (""Misty Mountain Hop"" grooves more than any song without bass should), deepening and coloring <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/page-mn0000089021"">Page</a> 's riffs, letting the band bounce out and return to center.

This is so good that this is how you want to remember them: older, perhaps wiser, and still majestic. </p>"

The playful side of <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/believe-mw0002357910"">Believe</a> is not well-suited for earnest, stripped-down renderings. Party anthems like ""Beauty and a Beat"" and lines like ""Chillin' by the fire while we eatin' fondue,"" from ""Boyfriend,"" seem silly when performed with the singer in serious artist mode. Unsurprisingly, the material that required less of a transformation -- such as ""As Long as You Love Me"" and ""Be Alright"" -- fares better. There's some appeal in the new songs: the destined-to-be-a-fan-favorite ""Yellow Raincoat,"" the adequate ""I Would"" (which is not acoustic), and the sad post-breakup piano ballad ""Nothing Like Us,"" the last of which was written by <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bieber-mn0002165952"">Bieber</a> alone and seems quite personal. </p>"

Those films all fell victim to endless delays -- Alpha Dog aired at Sundance 2006 but didn't see release that year, nor did Black Snake Moan, which got pushed back until 2007, leaving Edison Force, a roundly panned Shattered Glass-styled thriller that sneaked out onto video, as the first <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/timberlake-mn0000312890"">Timberlake</a> film to see the light of day -- but even if silver screen stardom proved elusive, <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/justin-mn0000312890"">Justin</a> didn't seem phased at all, and his fall 2006 album <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/futuresex-lovesounds-mw0000542362"">FutureSex/LoveSounds</a> proves why: he'd been pouring all his energy into his second album to ensure that he didn't have a sophomore slump. </p>"

A little more than six months later, it was released, consisting of more recordings from <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/timberlake-mn0000312890"">Timberlake</a> 's May-June 2012 sessions with friend <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/timbaland-mn0000602378"">Timbaland</a> , <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jerome-harmon-mn0003144340"">Jerome Harmon</a> , and <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/james-fauntleroy-mn0000942860"">James Fauntleroy</a> . The construction is similar to that of the first volume. At 74 minutes and 11 (or 12) songs, it's a little longer, and much of it has that feel-over-concision, part-improv -- just spit ballin'! -- makeup. It starts more energetically, with a frivolous and robust jam for singles night at a zoo or Rainforest Cafê©. The funkier and more frantic ""True Blood"" increases the energy and humor, swaps out nature effects for fantasy howls. Its ideas are exhausted after three and a half minutes, but it continues for another six. Relatively concise, ""Cabaret,"" a standout featuring <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/drake-mn0001035294"">Drake</a> , revamps <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/timbaland-mn0000602378"">Timbaland</a> 's trademark stuttering drums and has some of <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/timberlake-mn0000312890"">Timberlake</a> 's more clever/nauseating lines: ""If sex is a contest, then you're coming first""; ""'Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we're laying in a manger."" Serving the same purpose of ""Suit &amp; Tie,"" ""Take Back the Night"" is another throwback to sophisticated disco-funk, but it resembles a cover of a deep soundtrack cut rather than a fresh spin on a classic. The second half is a laborious crawl, a variety of glorified and slow bonus tracks. It consists of slumping quasi blues, passable falsetto-soul balladry, a jilted post-breakup number with an extended coda, a blaring kiss-off that shifts into air-horn-enhanced dub (why not?), and a squeaky-clean adult pop love song. That's five songs in 37 minutes, though it's really six songs counting the hidden bit -- a solo acoustic ballad containing the line ""If I could, I'd fly you away on a big ol' pair of wings."" The album was sold separately and bundled with part one, not as <em>The Complete 20/20 Experience</em> , but as <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-20-20-experience-the-complete-experience-mw0002569544"">The 20/20 Experience: The Complete Experience</a> .
