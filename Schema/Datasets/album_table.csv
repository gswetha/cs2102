Where <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gaga-mn0000994823"">GaGa</a> excels, and why she crossed over, is how she doesn_ã_t leave all this as a collection of hooks and rhythms, she shapes them into full-blown pop songs, taking the time to let the album breathe with chillout ballads and percolating new wave, like the title track that echoes <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gwen-stefani-mn0000546214"">Gwen Stefani</a> in dance diva mode.

Inevitably, this emphasis on production means the pop in <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/artpop-mw0002573777"">ARTPOP</a> winds up diminished; perhaps it's ""pop"" in the pop-art sense, as it's shamelessly intentionally populist, but as pop music it's stiff, relying not on hooks in either its melody or rhythm, but rather a full-on glitz blitz that can dazzle as often as it tires. Lost in her self-generated mythos, <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gaga-mn0000994823"">Gaga</a> doesn't much care whether her music sticks as long as she's not ignored -- even such seemingly soul-baring moments as the single-spotlight showcase ""Dope"" aren't confessional so much as gear shifts designed to capture attention -- and <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/artpop-mw0002573777"">ARTPOP</a> continually demands attention as it eschews the notion of love, right down to how all the sex songs deliberately separate the body from the soul.

This same arrogance glides her through songs about style -- the ludicrous ""Donatella,"" a tribute to Versace that borders on character assassination; ""Fashion!,"" which isn't a <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-bowie-mn0000531986"">David Bowie</a> cover, no matter how much it longs to be -- and through the songs about drugs, a cycle that takes her toward a concluding coda where <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gaga-mn0000994823"">Gaga</a> stands resplendent in the applause. The concept is artful and logical, yet <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/artpop-mw0002573777"">ARTPOP</a> never insinuates or settles in the subconscious; it always assaults, determined to make an impression even when all it has to say is that it doesn't have much to say. </p>"She Wolf,11/23/09,13,"Latin,Pop/Rock,R&B,",33,http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_400/MI0002/915/MI0002915675.jpg?partner=allrovi.com,"<p> Last time around, <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/shakira-mn0000790797"">Shakira</a> touched upon so many styles she couldn_ã_t be contained on one album, splitting <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/oral-fixation-mw0000773317"">Oral Fixation</a> in two.

A hit of that magnitude is hard to follow, so it shouldn't be a great surprise that she toiled on its sequel for upward of four years. What is surprising is that the subsequent album was split in two -- ê_ la Kill Bill -- with the first being devoted to Spanish tunes and the second consisting entirely of English songs; the teasing titles <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/fijacion-oral-vol-1-mw0000207618"">Fijacion Oral, Vol. 1</a> and <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/oral-fixation-vol-2-mw0000258830"">Oral Fixation, Vol. 2</a> indicate which is which and which hit the market first. It's kind of a sharp move to release <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/fijacion-oral-mw0000207618"">Fijacion Oral</a> first, since it not only satisfies her longtime fans who have been waiting a long time for a collection of brand-new Spanish material (she hasn't delivered one since 1998's <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/d%C3%B3nde-est%C3%A1n-los-ladrones-mw0000045951"">Dê_nde Estêçn los Ladrones?</a> ), it also subtly signals that she won't be placing American success above anything else. Similarly, <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/fijacion-oral-mw0000207618"">Fijacion Oral</a> smartly straddles the line between traditional Latin pop and the sexy, splashy dance-pop and bombastic adult contemporary pop that made <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/laundry-service-mw0000016418"">Laundry Service</a> a big hit in the U.S.: its heart is in the former, but the production -- the omnipresent <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-rubin-mn0000356250"">Rick Rubin</a> serves as the executive producer -- is slick and bright, enough to make the first single, ""La Tortura,"" sound like a natural for American radio (even if it will never be played because it's sung in Spanish). Despite the surface sheen, <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/fijacion-oral-mw0000207618"">Fijacion Oral</a> is proudly a Latin pop record, and it conforms to the conventions of its genre, alternating between melodramatic ballads and insistent dance tunes, sometimes working a sleek bossa nova number into the equation for good measure (the terrific ""Obtener un Sê_,"" which sounds like it could have been a big hit in the late '60s). Even if it doesn't break convention, it nevertheless does its job extremely well, with an ample amount of style and flair, as well as more songcraft than <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/shakira-mn0000790797"">Shakira</a> is usually given credit for.

Ochoa</a> or <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lester-mendez-mn0000826685"">Lester Mendez</a> , and these ten originals (the 12-track album includes two alternate versions) have a combination of commercial savvy and smart writing, making this album a small triumph, proof that <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/shakira-mn0000790797"">Shakira</a> can not only return to her roots, but expand upon them. Since this is a Latin pop record through and through, it will not cross over the way that <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/laundry-service-mw0000016418"">Laundry Service</a> did, but that's by design: <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/fijacion-oral-vol-1-mw0000207618"">Fijacion Oral, Vol. 1</a> will conquer half of the world, and the other half will follow with <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/oral-fixation-vol-2-mw0000258830"">Oral Fixation, Vol. 2</a> in six months' time.

King is not only a timeless singer and guitarist, he's also a natural-born entertainer, and on Live at the Regal the listener is treated to an exhibition of all three of his talents. Over percolating horn hits and rolling shuffles, King treats an enthusiastic audience (at some points, they shriek after he delivers each line) to a collection of some of his greatest hits. The backing band is razor-sharp, picking up the leader's cues with almost telepathic accuracy. King's voice is rarely in this fine of form, shifting effortlessly between his falsetto and his regular range, hitting the microphone hard for gritty emphasis and backing off in moments of almost intimate tenderness. Nowhere is this more evident than at the climax of ""How Blue Can You Get,"" where the Chicago venue threatens to explode at King's prompting. Of course, the master's guitar is all over this record, and his playing here is among the best in his long career. Displaying a jazz sensibility, King's lines are sophisticated without losing their grit. More than anything else, Live at the Regal is a textbook example of how to set up a live performance. Talking to the crowd, setting up the tunes with a vignette, King is the consummate entertainer. Live at the Regal is an absolutely necessary acquisition for fans of B.B. King or blues music in general. A high point, perhaps even the high point, for uptown blues.</p>"Live,2/19/08,12,"Blues,",23.15,http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_400/MI0002/489/MI0002489587.jpg?partner=allrovi.com,"<p> Recorded in the fall of 2006, shortly after <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bb-king-mn0000059156"">B.B.

In addition to his obvious talents as a guitarist and showman, he has also been fortunate in that his chosen style of music, a version of the blues growing out of the swing-influenced jump blues of the 1940s, has not only remained perennially popular but grown in acceptance. As performed here by <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-bb-king-blues-band-mn0002089320"">the B.B.

At one time, most of those solos were played by <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/king-mn0000059156"">King</a> on his guitar, but now he is content to give the showcase to his horn players, as he does on ""Blues Man,"" or organist <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/james-toney-mn0001469474"">James Toney</a> , who claims the lion's share of ""Rock Me Baby.""

He loosens his tie on this set though, recorded at a single show in February 2010. The veteran frontman tears into his staccato guitar solos with gusto here, extending the tunes and singing with a rawness often lacking in his studio work. His band also pushes harder, especially longtime keyboardist/songwriter <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jim-pugh-mn0000074339"">Jim Pugh</a> , whose featured solos match <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> 's own intensity and are spotlighted throughout. This is soul-bluesman <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> 's third live release in four years (2010's <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/authorized-bootleg-mw0001980946"">Authorized Bootleg</a> dated back to a 1987 show), but the only one that includes a full concert DVD -- adding two more cuts, ""Phone Booth"" and ""Twenty"" -- along with the audio. He has only recorded one studio disc in that time, four selections from which are reprised. Only a few songs will be familiar to anyone but hardcore fans, including spirited workouts on '80s hits ""Smoking Gun"" and ""Right Next Door,"" along with ""Our Last Time,"" the latter two already included on 2006's <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-from-across-the-pond-mw0000734663"">Live from Across the Pond</a> . Two other tracks also appear on that previous double concert CD, which raises the question of why, with as many albums as <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> has accumulated, he couldn't dig back and find different material. A cover of ""Sitting on Top of the World"" is dirtier than you'd expect, and in general the sweat flows when the guitarist pushes his R&amp;B deeper into the blues as his band grinds into a groove often absent from his more polished catalog. He pulls out guitar effects that creatively double-track his solo on ""Lotta Lovin',"" another ballad that sounds far more heartbroken and personal here than on 2003's <a class=""album-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/time-will-tell-mw0000036363"">Time Will Tell</a> , where it first appeared. <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> 's vocal howls and grunts as he tears into tight, energized guitar solos show that he's been captured on an inspired night, even on ""Smoking Gun,"" a tune he's been playing nightly for over two decades. It makes for a surprisingly tough and uncompromising performance that shows <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/robert-cray-mn0000830425"">Robert Cray</a> in a different light than many would have expected based solely on his impressive if somewhat similar-sounding and often sterile albums. </p>"Nothin But Love,8/27/12,11,"Blues,Pop/Rock,",32,http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_400/MI0003/425/MI0003425875.jpg?partner=allrovi.com,"<p> The differences in <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/robert-cray-mn0000830425"">Robert Cray</a> albums are subtle but noticeable to fans of the veteran soul-bluesman. He retains the same backing trio on this 2012 release as on 2009's studio disc, with the only major difference in personnel being the addition of noted roots producer <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kevin-shirley-mn0000769303"">Kevin Shirley</a> . Lyrically detailed story ballads about the trials and tribulations of love, with an emphasis on broken relationships, remain his strong suit as song titles such as ""Sadder Days,"" ""Fix This,"" ""I'll Always Remember You,"" ""Won't Be Coming Home,"" and even the album's title imply. Yet there are enough change-ups and excellent songs here to keep the pace varied. Horns that <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> hasn't utilized in a while make a welcome appearance on a few key tunes such as the big-band swing of ""I'll Always Remember You"" (which seems like a tribute to <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ray-charles-mn0000046861"">Ray Charles</a> ) and the terrifically melodic, midtempo ""Blues Get Off My Shoulder."" A little <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chuck-berry-mn0000120521"">Chuck Berry</a> rocking in the snappy and humorous ""Side Dish"" shows that this band can crank up the energy when the occasion calls for it. Even if their brand of rock &amp; roll is a little on the clean-cut side, the track has a rawness and good-time feeling that is typically not associated with <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> . But the album's emotional and philosophical centerpiece is the nearly nine-minute ""I'm Done Cryin'."" This searing, contemporary portrait is of a male protagonist who has lost his home and his job to outsourcing but retains his dignity ""because I'm still a man."" <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/shirley-mn0000769303"">Shirley</a> adds understated but beautifully arranged strings to emphasize the sheer desperation of the situation then strips them away, leaving just <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> 's soulful voice. Add one of the guitarist's patented terse, quivering solos that feels like a crying vocal, and you get a tour de force track that is one of the highlights of <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> 's bulging catalog. And with 15 previous albums, that's saying plenty. The description of how a wrecked marriage is revealed in the empty residence a couple left behind in ""Great Big Old House"" is prime <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cray-mn0000830425"">Cray</a> , too, and a worthy successor to any of his other popular busted matrimony songs. Even if the guitarist has worked this terrain plenty of times before, he is still refining and even improving the template. That makes this another quality entry in a catalog of albums over a three-decade-and-counting-year career that has remarkably few weak spots. </p>"Live from the Montreal International Jazz Festival,3/9/10,31,"Pop/Rock,",56.3,http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_400/MI0003/132/MI0003132405.jpg?partner=allrovi.com,"<p> <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ben-harper-mn0000792733"">Ben Harper</a> is no stranger to live albums.

The skeletal, ghostly, repeated riff of the deadly gunslinger ""I Ride at Dawn"" is a stark reminder of how less is more as Harper's slide enhances the dangerous elements reflected in the song's ominous lyrics.

Unsurprisingly, the material that required less of a transformation -- such as ""As Long as You Love Me"" and ""Be Alright"" -- fares better. There's some appeal in the new songs: the destined-to-be-a-fan-favorite ""Yellow Raincoat,"" the adequate ""I Would"" (which is not acoustic), and the sad post-breakup piano ballad ""Nothing Like Us,"" the last of which was written by <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bieber-mn0002165952"">Bieber</a> alone and seems quite personal. </p>"FutureSex/LoveSounds,9/12/06,12,"Pop/Rock,",16.5,http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_400/MI0000/728/MI0000728878.jpg?partner=allrovi.com,"<p> Give <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/justin-timberlake-mn0000312890"">Justin Timberlake</a> credit for this: he has ambition.

A little more than six months later, it was released, consisting of more recordings from <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/timberlake-mn0000312890"">Timberlake</a> 's May-June 2012 sessions with friend <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/timbaland-mn0000602378"">Timbaland</a> , <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jerome-harmon-mn0003144340"">Jerome Harmon</a> , and <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/james-fauntleroy-mn0000942860"">James Fauntleroy</a> . The construction is similar to that of the first volume. At 74 minutes and 11 (or 12) songs, it's a little longer, and much of it has that feel-over-concision, part-improv -- just spit ballin'! -- makeup. It starts more energetically, with a frivolous and robust jam for singles night at a zoo or Rainforest Cafê©. The funkier and more frantic ""True Blood"" increases the energy and humor, swaps out nature effects for fantasy howls. Its ideas are exhausted after three and a half minutes, but it continues for another six. Relatively concise, ""Cabaret,"" a standout featuring <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/drake-mn0001035294"">Drake</a> , revamps <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/timbaland-mn0000602378"">Timbaland</a> 's trademark stuttering drums and has some of <a class=""name-link"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/timberlake-mn0000312890"">Timberlake</a> 's more clever/nauseating lines: ""If sex is a contest, then you're coming first""; ""'Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we're laying in a manger."" Serving the same purpose of ""Suit &amp; Tie,"" ""Take Back the Night"" is another throwback to sophisticated disco-funk, but it resembles a cover of a deep soundtrack cut rather than a fresh spin on a classic. The second half is a laborious crawl, a variety of glorified and slow bonus tracks. It consists of slumping quasi blues, passable falsetto-soul balladry, a jilted post-breakup number with an extended coda, a blaring kiss-off that shifts into air-horn-enhanced dub (why not?), and a squeaky-clean adult pop love song. That's five songs in 37 minutes, though it's really six songs counting the hidden bit -- a solo acoustic ballad containing the line ""If I could, I'd fly you away on a big ol' pair of wings.""
